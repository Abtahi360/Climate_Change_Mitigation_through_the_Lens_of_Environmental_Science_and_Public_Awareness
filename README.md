# **Climate Change Mitigation through the Lens of Environmental Science and Public Awareness**  
🌍 *Exploring the role of environmental science and public perception in climate action.*  

## **Abstract**  
This research examines the **intersection of environmental science and public awareness** in mitigating **climate change**. Key areas explored:  

🔹 **Climate mitigation strategies** (renewable energy, reforestation, carbon reduction)  
🔹 **Impact of demographic factors** (age, gender, occupation) on climate attitudes  
🔹 **Public awareness & participation levels** in climate action  

📊 **Findings (SPSS Analysis & Chi-Square Tests):**  
✅ **Students** are the most active in climate action  
✅ **Ages 21–30** prioritize **GHG reduction & biodiversity conservation**  
✅ **Gender differences** in climate perception:  
   - **Males** focus on human or natural causes individually  
   - **Females** see climate change as a mix of both
